Given an array A[ ] of n elements and an integer k in the range [1, n], the function
SELECT (dtype A[ ], int n, int k)
returns the kth smallest element of the array. (For example, k = 1 is the smallest element, k = n is the
largest, and k = n/2 is the median.) In this programming assignment, you are to implement SELECT
using three different algorithms as described below, and compare their performance in terms of the number
of key comparisons. (Do not perform the key comparisons in-line. Rather, use a function to perform each
key comparison, while incrementing a counter.)
