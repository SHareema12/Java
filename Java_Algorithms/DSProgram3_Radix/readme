This assignment is to alphabetically sort n strings, each with maximum-length of k = 21 characters. (You
may assume n â‰¤ 1000.) The algorithm to be used is LSD (Least-Significant-Digit-First) radixsort. The
algorithm must run in O(n) time, where one character operation takes one unit of time. You must handle
the strings on a character-by-character basis, one character at a time. (Each character operation takes
O(1) time.)
The strings consist of only upper-case letters A-Z, with no space. The strings need not be distinct. (For
example, there may be several PATEL in a class list!)
Each string has at most k characters. Shorter strings must be padded with blank characters (as they are
read from a file) to reach the fixed length of k.
